My paper, based on my undergraduate thesis titled 'A Second Look at the Portability of Deep Learning Side-Channel Attacks over EM Traces,' has been accepted to the 27th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions, and Defenses (RAID 2024). I will be presenting this work at the conference in Padua, Italy, this fall!
