# About Me
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Texas A&M University in Computer Science, specializing in Malware Detection. Concurrently, I hold a role as a Research Scientist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital's Advanced Imaging Center, where I focus on advancing multimodal imaging techniques for clinical applications. My research leverages state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies and multimodal ML pipelines to innovate diagnostic approaches, aiming to reduce uncertainties in patient care.
I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, culminating in a thesis on Advanced Deep Learning Side Channel Attacks, supervised by Dr. Boyang Wang. My academic journey includes authoring four publications, three of which as lead author, in prestigious IEEE and ACM conferences dedicated to security and hardware."
