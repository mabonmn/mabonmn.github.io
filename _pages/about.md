# About Me
I am a Deep Learning Researcher specializing in data security and privacy. I work on decrypting encryption keys using Deep Learning-based Side Channel attacks. I have experience in predicting and recovering encryption keys from different datasets with obfuscations and optimizations. As a Software Engineer, I have developed auto grading systems for programming courses, resulting in cost reduction and efficient grading. In computer vision research, I processed videos using machine learning models for summarization and classification. I have skills in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, as well as machine learning frameworks such as Tensor Flow and PyTorch.
