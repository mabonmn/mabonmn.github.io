  abstract={Deep-learning side-channel attacks can reveal encryption keys on a device by analyzing power consumption with neural networks. However, the portability of deep-learning side-channel attacks can be affected when training data (from the training device) and test data (from the test device) are discrepant. Recent studies have exam-ined the portability of deep-learning side-channel attacks against hardware discrepancies between two devices. In this paper, we investigate the portability of deep-learning side-channel attacks against software discrepancies between the training device and test device. Specifically, we examine four factors that can lead to software discrepancies, including random delays, instruction rewriting, optimization levels, and code obfuscation. Our experi- mental results show that software discrepancies caused by each factor can significantly downgrade the attack performance of deep-learning side-channel attacks, and even prevent an attacker from recovering keys. To mitigate the impacts of software discrepancies, we investigate three mitigation methods, including adjusting Points of Interest, domain adaptation, and multi-domain training, from the perspective of an attacker. Our results indicate that multi-domain training is the most effective approach among the three, but it can be difficult to scale given the diversity of software discrepancies.},
